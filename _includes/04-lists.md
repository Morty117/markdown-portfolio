* One of my many favorite things to do is play video games. I love First Person Shooters and Action/Adventure games.
* I also love to read the bible, books about motivation, business, war stories and some science fiction or adventure books.
* As distractions, I watch TV shows with some of my favorites being Vikings, Bob's Burgers, The Office, Impractical Jokers and many others.
* And on my free time, I love to lift weights.
